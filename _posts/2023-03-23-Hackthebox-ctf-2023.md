# Hack the Box Cyber Apocalypse 2023 Complete! (≧∇≦)ﾉ

Cyber Apocalypse 2023 was a jeopardy style CTF spanning multiple categories such as: forensics, hardware, pwn, misc, web, machine learning, cryptography.

This is my first CTF that I have entered though I continue to rooms on TryHackMe, using the HTB Academy and working through the PicoCTF Gym.
I've come to understand during this short experience - there's nothing quite like a live CTF. I hope to continue doing CTFs in future, at least, as much as time allows.

(Will be adding more posts and formatting as needed)


## warmup

-------------------------

This was a fun little flag to be had after joining the Hack the Box discord. It was hiding in the announcements section as:

``` text
HTB{l3t_th3_tr3asur3_hunt1ng_b3g1n!}
```

## trapped source (web)
--------------------

![trapped-source-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4TRXIA/HTB-CA-CTF-2023-Writeup-Images/main/trapped_source_site.png)

This was a pretty straightforward and hese were the steps I took for this challenge:

- Viewed the page source (Ctrl + U or Right-Click + View Page Source)
- Scanned the page for any mention of the HTB flag format HTB{...}
- No flag text present, so I checked for any scripts available
- Found a script named "correctPin" and tried the code "8291"
- Got the flag!
