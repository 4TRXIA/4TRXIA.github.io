# Hack the Box Cyber Apocalypse 2023 Complete! (≧∇≦)ﾉ

Cyber Apocalypse 2023 was a jeopardy style CTF spanning multiple categories such as: forensics, hardware, pwn, misc, web, machine learning, cryptography.

This is my first CTF that I have entered though I continue to rooms on TryHackMe, using the HTB Academy and working through the PicoCTF Gym.
I've come to understand during this short experience - there's nothing quite like a live CTF. I hope to continue doing CTFs in future, at least, as much as time allows.

(Will be adding more posts and formatting as needed)


## warmup

-------------------------

This was a fun little flag to be had after joining the Hack the Box discord. It was hiding in the announcements section as:
